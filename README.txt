#ideas: algorithm to calculate sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)
transform a number to a factorial
 - par_ou_impar is the first "game" I made with the Gustavo Guanabara's python course. It is a Odds or Evens with the computer.
 - calcula.py simply aproximates pi with a polygon of n sides inscribed in a circunference of radius 1.
 - linear_equations_system.py just uses the numpy library to solve systems of 3 linear equations ang gives back the x, y and z in a "organized" way.
 Its very arcaic, even for my beginner criteria.
